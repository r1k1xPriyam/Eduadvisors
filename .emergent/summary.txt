<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive website for their educational consultancy, Edu Advisor. The initial request was for a professional landing page. The scope has since expanded to a full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Public Website**: A multi-section landing page (Hero, About, Services, Courses, Success Gallery) with a student query form. A GET COUNSELLING NOW button on the hero section should trigger the existing query popup. The site should support both light and dark modes.
2.  **Login Portals**: Secure login portals for Admin and Consultant roles, featuring interactive background images and a theme (light/dark) toggle.
3.  **Admin Dashboard**:
    *   A secure, mobile-responsive portal for the  user with light/dark mode support.
    *   View all student queries and consultant reports.
    *   **Bulk Delete**: Ability to delete data (Queries, Reports, Calls, Admissions, All) in bulk with filters (consultant, date range) and password confirmation for security.
    *   **Admissions Management**: Add, edit, and delete student admission records.
    *   **Consultant Management**: Add, edit (user ID and password only, name is read-only), and remove consultant accounts.
    *   **Call Statistics**: View aggregated call statistics for all consultants (total, successful, failed, attempted).
4.  **Consultant Portal**:
    *   A secure, mobile-responsive portal for consultants with unique credentials and light/dark mode support.
    *   **Daily Reporting**: Submit detailed student calling reports.
    *   **Quick Call Logging**: A separate, simpler form to quickly log call outcomes (Success, Fail, Attempt) without full student details.
    *   **View Data**: View their own submitted reports, credited admissions, and total call statistics.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. The application is feature-complete according to the user's latest requests. All core portals (Public Website, Admin Dashboard, Consultant Dashboard) are implemented. Key features include admissions tracking, a dual system for consultant reporting (detailed reports vs. quick call logs), bulk data deletion for admins, mobile-responsive design across dashboards, and a sitewide light/dark theme toggle. The backend has been extended to support all these new features.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Implementing a sitewide light/dark theme toggle. This involved creating a , wrapping the main , updating , and adding toggle controls and dark-mode-specific styles to all major pages and components (, , , , ).
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - There are no known bugs or issues. The primary pending item is the verification of the last implemented feature.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Verify the dark/light mode implementation. (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - **Where to resume**: The theme toggle has been added to all relevant pages. The next step is to conduct a thorough test to ensure all components, pages (public site, login pages, admin dashboard, consultant dashboard), modals, and text are rendered correctly in both light and dark modes. The agent only performed a cursory screenshot check of the main page.
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: This will confirm that the dark/light mode feature is working flawlessly across the entire application, providing a polished user experience.
     - **Status**: TESTING PENDING
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    - The user has not specified any new tasks. The project is functionally complete based on all requests to date.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Authentication**: The current -based session is insecure and should be upgraded to a proper token-based (JWT) system.
- **Component Complexity**:  and  are now extremely large. They should be broken down into smaller, single-responsibility components (e.g., separate components for each tab's content) to improve maintainability.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The immediate priority is to thoroughly test the newly implemented dark/light mode feature across the entire application to ensure visual consistency and functionality.
- Once verified, the application is considered feature-complete based on all user requests to date. You should confirm this with the user and await further instructions.
- Be prepared to discuss potential future improvements, such as upgrading the authentication system.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
 - **User:** I need both light and dark background options for each webpage. And give me the admin's user id and password, please. (COMPLETED, PENDING VERIFICATION)
 - **User:** I need an option for consultants to see total calls, this should be viewable by the admin as well. Make the app fully smartphone-friendly. Allow admins to bulk delete data with password confirmation. Add interactive backgrounds to login portals. (COMPLETED)
 - **User:** The admin panel should also be smartphone screen interactive. (COMPLETED)
 - **User:** Give a button GET COUNSELLING NOW on the main website that triggers the query popup. Remove STUDY ABROAD from the website and replace the Engineering Dreams image. (COMPLETED)
