<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive website for their educational consultancy, Edu Advisor. The initial request was for a professional landing page. The scope has since expanded to a full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Public Website**: A multi-section landing page (Hero, About, Services, Courses, etc.) with a student query form. When a user first visits, a popup modal should appear to capture student leads. The website should be visually appealing with context-related images.

    *   View all consultant reports, with options to filter by date and consultant, and delete them.
    *   Manage consultant accounts: Add, edit (user ID and password only), and remove consultants.
    *   Manage student admissions: A dedicated section to add, edit, and remove records of students who have secured admission through a consultant. This includes details like student name, course, college, admission date, consultant name, payout amount, and payout status.
4.  **Consultant Portal**:
    *   A secure portal for each of the 25 consultants with unique credentials.
    *   Submit daily student calling reports.
    *   View their own submitted reports, with an option to filter by date.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. The public-facing website, admin dashboard, and consultant portal are implemented. Most core features like student queries, consultant reporting, and admin management are functional. The EDU BUDDY AI chatbot was implemented and subsequently removed per the user's request. The backend has been updated with new endpoints for admission tracking and modified consultant management, but the corresponding frontend is not yet built.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing a large, multi-part feature request from the user. This involved:
        1.  Removing the EDU BUDDY AI chatbot feature entirely.
        2.  Implementing an Admissions tracking system for the admin to log successful student placements and for consultants to view their credited admissions.
        3.  Restricting consultant management so admins can only edit a consultant's User ID and password, not their name.
        4.  Adding a new Success Gallery section with interactive images to the main website.
